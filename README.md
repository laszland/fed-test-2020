## Specification
### General instructions:
1. Please use for the logo the image attached - logo.png
2. For the other icons - please use font-awesome icons.
3. Text font should be 'Ubuntu' (Google font).
4. please use the data from the file - https://d2t3o0osqtjkex.cloudfront.net/tgTest/prods.json for the
products list:
    1. every item needs to include – product image, title, crossed-price and price.
    2. In mobile view – 2 items in a row, for tablet and wider screens – 4 items in a row and the
sort/filter buttons – align to the left.
    3. The products titles display will be no more than 2 lines, with ellipsis if needed.
### Functionality:
1. The number of the results should be updated according the data.
1. Sort button – when clicking on it a dropdown will display with the options – ‘price low to high’ and
‘price high to low’. Please create this sorting functionality (design attached - products-page2.png).
2. Filter button - when clicking on it a dropdown will display with the options – ‘gold’ and ‘silver’. If
choosing one of the options, the products list will be updated accordingly and also the number of results.
Please take the data from the ‘material’ properties in the Json. please note – ‘gold’ filter = all the ‘material’ properties that include ‘gold’ in the name (for example – ‘Gold Vermeil’), and ‘silver’ filter = all the ‘material’ properties that include ‘silver’ in the name (for example – ‘Silver/Diamond’).
3. After refreshing the page – the previous choices (sort and filter) and data will be displayed.
4. When clicking on product item – a popup appears with the relevant item description and a button
with link to the product page (see attached - products-page3.png).
clicking on the ‘x’ or the gray overlay will close the popup.
5. Bonus – add a button above the sort/filter buttons to toggle the products list view between 2 items
to 1 item in a row.

## Personal Comments
1. I've changed the design of the popup (bolder title, expra space between title and description) based on UX/UI design patterns.
2. I solved all the functions and design specification but ellipsis. Regardless of the outcome of this recruitment process I more than curious about the possible solution.
